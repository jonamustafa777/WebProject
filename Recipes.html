  <h2 class="cuisine-title">Italian Cuisine</h2>
 
  <p class="cuisine-description">
    Italian cuisine is one of the most beloved and influential in the world, celebrated for its simplicity, freshness, and bold flavors. Rooted in ancient Roman traditions and shaped by regional diversity, Italian cooking focuses on seasonal ingredients, olive oil, fresh herbs, and artisanal cheeses. Pasta, pizza, and risotto are global favorites, but each region of Italy has its own specialties — from the hearty ragù of Bologna to the seafood-rich dishes of Sicily. Italian cuisine has inspired countless variations worldwide, but its soul remains in the balance between rustic tradition and refined artistry, where every meal is a celebration of family, culture, and passion for food.

        <p class="card-text">Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta.

It's said to have come about in the mid-1800s, when a team of glassmakers took some of the saffron they were using to color the stained glass windows in Milan's Duomo cathedral and added it to the risotto being served at dinner. What started as a prank became one of the most iconic Italian plates. This version hews to the original.</p>
